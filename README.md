This dataset is designed for sentiment analysis at the entity level, focusing on Twitter messages. 
For each message and its associated entity, the goal is to determine the sentiment expressed towards that entity.
The dataset categorizes sentiment into three classes: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. 
Messages that do not pertain to the entity in question (i.e., they are not relevant) are classified as Neutral.
